The C# queue is a FIFO queue collection class in the System.Collection namespace. Storing elements in FIFO style (First In, First Out), the C# queue contains elements in precisely the order they were added, with objects added at one end and removed from the opposite end. This is the opposite order of the Stack collection. Both queues and stacks are useful when you need to store information temporarily, such as elements that you discard after retrieving their values.
